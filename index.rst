Writing docs with Sphinx & readthedocs.org
==========================================


What is Sphinx?
===============

``Sphinx is a tool that makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful documentation, written by Georg Brandl and licensed under the BSD license.``

The main Python stdlib docs are written in Sphinx as well as other numerous Python projects.

Setting up a Sphinx Project
===========================

Sphinx is very easy to setup.  Make an empty project directory, make a
virtualenv and then install Sphinx into it::

    $ pip install Sphinx==1.1.3

After this has completed, run the ``sphinx-quickstart`` command.
