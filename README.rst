A presentation for a PythonKC meeting on Sphinx and readthedocs.org.  Created using Sphinx and a sphinx extension called `hieroglyph`_ for creating the html5 slides.  How meta of me.

To build the presentation:

* pip install -r requirements.txt
* run `make slides`
* open index.html in _build/slides

.. _hieroglyph: https://github.com/nyergler/hieroglyph
