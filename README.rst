Writing docs with Sphinx & readthedocs.org
==========================================

A presentation for a PythonKC meeting on Sphinx and readthedocs.org.  Created using Sphinx and a sphinx extension called `hieroglyph`_ for creating the html5 slides.  How meta of me.

To build the presentation::

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    $ make slides

Open the index.html file in _build/slides

.. _hieroglyph: https://github.com/nyergler/hieroglyph
